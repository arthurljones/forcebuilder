Simple Battletech force builder for Alpha Strike

The main idea of ForceBuilder is to remove the mental overhead of building a Battletech force based on your current list of models available. 

Nothing saps or slows down a potential gaming session more than stopping to put together a list of forces. 

This app will help eliminate the decision fatigue that can come with trying to get a game of Alpha Strike planned. 

**Basic Functions:**
- Upload a list of your current Battletech models
- Set a Point Value limit for the game.
- Get a list of models and their respective varients
- Export that List for reference and selection on MasterUnitList.
